<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraoperative Radiation Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electron IORT</li><li>Intraoperative Brachytherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT) encompasses two primary types: Electron IORT and Intraoperative Brachytherapy. Electron IORT uses high-energy electron beams delivered directly to the tumor site during surgery, allowing for precise targeting and minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissues. In contrast, Intraoperative Brachytherapy involves the placement of radioactive sources directly within or near the tumor, delivering localized radiation while limiting exposure to adjacent organs. Both techniques enhance treatment efficacy and are increasingly utilized in surgical oncology for better patient outcomes.</p></p>
