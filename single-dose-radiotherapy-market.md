<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Dose Radiotherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Beam Radiotherapy</li><li>Internal Beam Radiotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Single Dose Radiotherapy market encompasses two primary types: External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) and Internal Beam Radiotherapy (IBRT). EBRT involves delivering high doses of radiation from outside the body, targeting tumors non-invasively, making it suitable for various cancer types. In contrast, IBRT, also known as brachytherapy, involves placing radioactive sources directly inside or close to the tumor. This method allows for a concentrated dose to the cancerous tissue while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissues.</p></p>
